This book was set up for the participants in Robert's webinar on March 20, 2025, which can be found on Zenodo at [doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.15058450](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.15058450).

It is meant to give an idea for the steps involved in making OER, including using AI, as well as making a book. Please feel very very welcome to contribute or interact with this repository!
